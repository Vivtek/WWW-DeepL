WWW-DeepL

This module provides a quick-and-easy interface to the DeepL translation engine, which provides a JSON API for paid users.

It also provides a command-line interface to the engine; under Windows, the command-line interface can take its
source text from the Clipboard, translate it, and paste it back to the Clipboard. This makes it easy to integrate
with basically any toolset without the need for a plugin.
